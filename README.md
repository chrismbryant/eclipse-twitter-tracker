# eclipse-twitter-tracker

I am working on writing a program to mine Twitter data from August 21, 2017 (about 9am PDT to 3pm EDT) for mentions of the solar eclipse to see if by using frequency of mentions alone, we can track the path of the moon's shadow throughout the day. Using this data, I hope to generate a changing map of the United States with counties shaded according to proportional tweet volume referencing the eclipse. I will also compare this path to the true path and see if there are any interesting conclusions to be made (Twitter mentions lagging behind or anticipating the eclipse, Twitter shadow area compared to the actual region of totality, tweet content of partial eclipse experiencers vs total eclipse experiencers, etc.)
